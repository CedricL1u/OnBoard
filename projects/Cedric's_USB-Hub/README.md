# Cedric's USB Hub

<!-- My board is a USB-Hub that adds an extra usb-a port to my computer. -->

<!--I started with the USB-Hub tutorial where I learned how to create a schematic and turn it into a pcb design. After that, I decided that I would want to 3D print my own enclosure for the usb hub so I added some screwholes. Some challenges that I encoutnered were that my 2 male usb-a ports were too close together and I couldn't craate a screwhole. When I tried to move the usb hubs apart, it messed up all my wires and I had to reroute everything. Instead of rerouting everything manually, I learned there was a auto router, so I used that. For the screwholes, I found out I could extend my pcb board and I could put a slothole. I then imported my design to Fusion 360 where I designed a custom enclosure. I plan on upgrading this design later, adding a usb-a port, hdmi port, and increasing the voltage the ports can support.    -->
